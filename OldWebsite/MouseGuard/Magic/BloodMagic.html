            <h2>Summary</h2>
          <P>Blood Magic makes the use of blood stones in order access life energy. These stones absorb the life of sacrifices and convert it into magical energy. Since the Manifestation of the Pillars of Hojo, the extra spiritual energy has allowed for the creation of new blood stones of lesser power by using stones of greater power. Blood magic has the subdisiplines of Curses, Subjegation, and Covent.</P>
          <P>Stones are broken down into four power levels, Major, Minor, Lesser, and Poor stones. Major stones have the power to control Spirits, where as the other stones just have a max amount of energy that can be stored in them.</P>
            <h2>Subdomains</h2>
          <H3>Curses</H3>
            
        	<p>The Curses subdomain focuses on naturally curses. These curses cause injury, death, or even boons to those they are cast on, as long as they do or do not meet the requirements of that curse. </p>
        	<p>In order to perform curses, the focus stone must first have enough energy in it. Then the curse must be known or created by the stone holding mouse. Next, a condition/s must be created, either one that must not be broken (such as don't drink water) or a goal (such as drink water), that will cause the activation of the curse. Next the mouse must then create the curse seal on the target. This will then cause the condition/s to be transmitted to the target's mind as the seal is seared into their flesh. The curse will then occur when the condition is meet. The power of the curse must be meet by a condition of an equal level (ie death can not be not breathing).        	</p>
       	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <H3>Subjugation</H3>
          <p>Subjugation focuses on bending and controlling others. These are more direct than curses as the target is under the direct control of the stone holder.</p>
          <p>To Perform a subjugation a mouse must touch the focus stone to their target or target a spirit in order to bind them. After that they must give the first command to them inorder to establish the mental link.</p>
            <p></p>
            <H3>Covent</H3>
          <p>Covent focuses on the restoration of life and limbs of the stone holding mouse. Depending on the type of stone, these effects vary but if the stone holding mouse loses life or limb it will be restored by automatically using the energy built up inside of the stone.</p>
