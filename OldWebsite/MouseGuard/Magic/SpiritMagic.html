            <h2>Summary</h2>
          <P>Spirit Magic makes use of the abundance of spiritual energy that is now latent in the world since the manifestation of the Pillars of Hojo. Users, often called Conduits, either consume Nossu herb or worship a relic blessed by a spirit in order to channel and gain part of a spirits power. As such, they often gain characteristics of the land and or spirit they are channeling as part of themself. Spirit Magic has the subdisiplines of Elemental, Manipulation,and
Rejuvenation. </P>
          <P>If a mouse consumes Nossu herb and possesses enough latent spiritual energy, he will become a conduit of a spirit that is in the area nearby.</P>
            <h2>Subdomains</h2>
          <H3>Elemental</H3>
            
       	  <p>The Elemental Subdomain is composed of spirits and conduits that harness the power of the elements of Earth, Wind, Fire, Nature, and Water. These mice become linked to a spirit in a domain and can control the envirnment around them, such as making flames from their hands, bridges from the land, or redirecting the flows of water.</p>
       	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <H3>Manipulation</H3>
          <p>The Manipulation subdomain is composed of spirits and conduits that control the laws of physics around them such as gravity, time and space. These mice and spirits can create great pressure, flight, slow or speed time in an area, or travel or transport things long distances quickly.</p>
          <p></p>
            <H3>Rejuvenation</H3>
          <p>The Rejuvenation subdomain is composed of spirits and conduits that can heal or restore life or the land to their former glory. These mice and spirits restore life and limbs or lands to what they were in times past.</p>
            <p></p>
