          <h4 class="Headers">Recorded by Fangzhi Wei, 940 AT</h4>
            <p class="Body">After the sacking of Edo and redistribution of power in the realm, the great spirit Rinju, the oldest spirit of Hojo, no longer had any followers. For several generations, our family had worked to subvert Rinju, and the time had come. Working with the Dreadwood Mercs, we gathered at dawn, with a party sixty mice strong, leading a 100 head of beetles carrying a total of 5000 pounds of salt and 500 gallons of kerosine. We worked our way up the mountain, taking half a month.</p>

<p class="Body">As we approached the peak, great storms began to rain down. We attempted to shelter in caves, but were quickly flooded out. Landslides took out a dozen beetles, another two dozen were lost in lighting strikes that lit up their kerosine packs. With no shelter, we pushed through the storms. Every shrine we passed on the ascent we burned to the ground; every statue was toppled and smashed. As we reached the peak, the storms began to wain. Rinju expended his energy with his wrath, and the floods made digging up his bones even easier.<br>
</p>

<p class="Body">The wooden temple at the peak was torn apart and a great pyre was made. Rinju's bones were splintered and salted; we burned them for three days and three nights. On the fourth morning, my brother Mingxing could no longer feel Rinju's presence; a great spirit had been destroyed.<br>
</p>

<p class="Body">Another two weeks were spent reclaiming the mountain in Kumogataru's name. The spirits bones were carried up the mountain, along with new fertile soil to bury them. Over the next few months, a grand marble temple was built; the exterior surrounded by 12 large pillars, each connected with a web of silk.</p>
