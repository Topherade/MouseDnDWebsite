   <h4 class="Headers">Recorded by Jinshen Wei, 948 AT.</h4>
   <p class="Body">When I first came to the Institute, I was enamored with the mystery of the Opal blood stone. Created in 934 AT by my ancestors, the stone had no apparent use. At this point the stone had gathered quite a bit of energy, with no way to expend it. In 948, I made my breakthrough. Having gathered the bones of a small lizard, I attempted to revive it. Over the next few minutes, a spirit fluttered in and out of existence before finally melting into the shadows of my study.</p>
    <p class="Body">I immediately took the stone to my cousin, the emperor and told him of my findings.</p>
    <p class="Body">
    My cousin communed with Komodoenisis that evening, and returned to tell me of his will. Soloenisis had recently taken flight from the White Mountain; we were to create a new spirit, submissive to Komodoensis, before a more powerful spirit settled the mountain.</p>
    <p class="Body">
    At this point, war with Ratin was at a new peak. I spent a moon on the front lines. After each skirmish, I'd go through the bodies and sacrifice the injured rats. At its greatest size, the stone had to be carted around, and weighed more than myself. I returned to Izu and gathered a party of researchers. We were able to track down the burial grounds of the cats slain in 928 AT, and recovered its bones. We then worked our way up the White Mountain, and buried the bones at the peak.</p>
    <p class="Body">
    Over the next few weeks, I prayed to Komodoenisis. Many of the researchers grew tired and left. The few who stayed were skeptics, but knew that if they left and I succeeded, they would be removed from the academy. I myself grew tired of their criticisms and complaints, so on the third night of the fourth week, I slit their throats and offered their stomachs. The opal bloodstone immediately drained all of its energy, and a great spirit appeared before me. The spirit was not as I expected; it had features of both a cat and squirrel. The spirit devoured the bodies of the researchers, then spoke it's name: Yogoroth.</p>
   <p class="Body">
   The spirit's presence seemed to revitalize the mountain. I stayed for the next week and observed trees grow in thickness, vines creep across the mountain, and flowers blossom before me. The spirit jumped from tree to tree and dropped fruit for me to eat. After a week, it must have decided I had overstayed my welcome. The spirit lashed out at me, sending a gust of energy that knocked me back against a tree. I left the mountain that morning, and noticed many corpses on my descent. On my return, the mountain was renamed to the Primal Mountain.</p>

   <h4 class="Headers">Recorded by JHanlu Wei, 989 AT.</h4>
   <p class="Body">Recorded Knowledge of Yogoroth </p>
    <p class="Body">
    Since its original creation, we have learned much about the spirit Yogoroth. He has bipolar nature; some mice ascend the mountain and are showered with gifts of fruit; others are consumed by the spirit as soon as they reach the peak. The only way to safely return from the mountain is by offering a sacrifice to appease Yogoroth's appetite.</p>
    <p class="Body">
    Any attempts to create a path to the peak have failed. Vegetation that is cut out regrows within a week. Stone laid on the ground to create steps are cracked by vines. As such, it is extremely difficult to ascend, and no temples have been built on the mountain. Although Yogoroth consumes a large amount of wildlife on the mountain, it still maintains a high population of insects and other lower life forms.It seems that the fertility of the mountain is not only applicable to vegetation.</p>
    <p class="Body">
    In 950 AT, Yogoroth lashed out, and a great burst of energy surged from the primal mountain. Beams of light were observed above the Immortal, Standing, and Primal Mountain. The Floating Mountain, lacking a base, sank beneath the sea and disappeared. Since this burst of energy, more magic and spiritual energy has been observed in Hojo.</p>
    <p class="Body">
   Since the founding of the Pillars of Hojo, Yogoroth has grown in strength. Her personality remains unstable and bipolar. Despite the difficulty we have had in understanding Yogoroth, the Institute unanimously agrees that the creation of Yogoroth has significantly improved the lives of all mice in Hojo, making us a stronger and more powerful country.</p>
