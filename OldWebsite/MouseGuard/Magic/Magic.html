            <h2>Introduction of Magic in Hojo</h2>
          <p>With the End of the Hijo Shogunate's Rule in 936 AT, the new NingyoMordla Shogunate under the leadership of Wiljoe IV, was advised to keep better track and research blood magic to prevent the violence and death that had just occured from occuring on that scall ever again. The First NingyMordla Legislation created <a href="TheIzuInstitution.html">The Izu Institution</a> to research and monitor magical and unbelieveable objects and events in Hojo. The Institute worked with the Wei Diamyo to monitor and record blood stones in the events leading up to the creation of Yogoroth in 948 AT and the manifestation of the Pillars of Hojo in 950 AT. Once these occured the rules that had once governed blood magic had changed. The list of registered magic items can be found <a href="MagicRegistry.html">here.</a></p>
            <H3>The Magic Triangle</H3>
          <p>Magic in Hojo has been broken down into three semidistict disiplines: Blood, Spirit and Cheese/Item Magic.</p>
            <h4><a href="BloodMagic.html">Blood Magic</a></h4>
            <P>Blood Magic makes the use of blood stones in order access life energy. These stones absorb the life of sacrifices and convert it into magical energy. Since the Manifestation of the Pillars of Hojo, the extra spiritual energy has allowed for the creation of new blood stones of lesser power by using stones of greater power. Blood magic has the subdisiplines of Curses, Subjugation, and Covent.</P>
            <h4><a href="SpiritMagic.html">Spirit Magic</a></h4>
          <p>Spirit Magic makes use of the abundance of spiritual energy that is now latent in the world since the manifestation of the Pillars of Hojo. Users, often called Conduits, either consume Nossu herb or worship a relic blessed by a spirit in order to channel and gain part of a spirits power. As such, they often gain characteristics of the land and or spirit they are channeling as part of themself. Spirit Magic has the subdisiplines of Elemental, Manipulation,and
Rejuvenation.  </p>
          <h4><a href="CheeseItemMagic.html">Cheese and Item Magic</a></h4>
            <p>Often considered the lesser of the Three Magics, Cheese and Item Magic lumps together magic that uses items of neither blood or spiritual origin. As cheese is holy and great, it has healling properities. Other items are ancient artifacts that possess a power that The Institute is unable to understand. The subdisiplines in Cheese and Item Magic are Food Magic and Artificing.</p>
