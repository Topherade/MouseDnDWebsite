            <h2>Summary</h2>
          <P>Often considered the lesser of the Three Magics, Cheese and Item Magic lumps together magic that uses items of neither blood or spiritual origin. As cheese is holy and great, it has healing properities. Other items are ancient artifacts that possess a power that The Institute is unable to understand. The subdisiplines in Cheese and Item Magic are Food Magic and Artificing.</P>
