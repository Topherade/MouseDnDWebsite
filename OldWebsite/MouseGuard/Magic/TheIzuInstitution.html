            <h3>Common Information About the Institute</h3>
            <p>The Izu Institute was the first national academy in Hojo, accepting qualified mice from all regions. The school was originally founded in 936 AT under the Charter of 936 AT with the purpose of keeping <a href="MagicRegistry.html">a registry of dangerous and magical items within Hojo.</a>  The Institute has since changed its purpose to study the unknown and abstract; mainly blood magic, spirits, and ancient artifacts.</p>
