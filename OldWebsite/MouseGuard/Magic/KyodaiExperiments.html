            <p class="Body">966 AT - The Institute began experiments on Kyodai Doraggu.  The first few mice who interacted with Kyodai all died within a few days; autopsies found that each of the researchers had black bile in their livers. It was soon discovered that Kyodai's sweat was poisonous.</p>

<p class="Body">Using the topaz blood stone to force Kyodai into communion with his spirit, the Institute was able to track down a dart frog spirit in the Deacon Swamps.  The Institute set up a remote academy around the spirit's bones, and experimented with curse magic on spirits.  The spirit was weakened to a point at which the academy could contain it.</p>

<p class="Body">The academy also experimented with forced communion, feeding young commoner mice Nossu herb in the presence of the spirit.  Most mice were rejected, but three subjects were able to conduit the spirit and gained similar, albeit weaker powers to that of Kyodai.  The Institute's main hypothesis from these experiments is that subjects must have similar personalities or experiences to that of the spirit in order to commune with the spirit.</p>

<p class="Body">The spirit later perished in 974 AT from over experimentation. Attempts to revive the spirit have all failed.  When the spirit passed, the current conduit began seizing, and died from shock.</p>
