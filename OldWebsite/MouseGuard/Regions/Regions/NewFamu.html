            <h3>Terrain</h3>
        	<p>New Famu consists of a large plains that spans from Izu to Dreadwood.  With such tall grass, it is often hard to maintain the main roads that run through it.  This in turns makes it a respit for those that are wanted, animals of prey, and nierdowells.  In the center of New Famu, FireStone Mesa stands high and proad.  The city is built into this strange, black, bouncy Mesa in the natural tunnnels that are provided.
