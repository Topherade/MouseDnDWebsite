            <h3>Terrain</h3>
        	<p>The Capital providence of the Hojo region consists of a very large fortress with a little farmland around it.  This fortress has three levels, each of which extends 100s of mice up, along with a large roof access.  The ground inside the fort varies from a wooly feeling, stone, or wood depending on which area on the fortress a mouse is in.  There are many different regions inside the fort, each with their own culture and geographic quirks.

        	<p>After the Great battle for Izu in 936 AT, the Mordla Diamyo stripped the South and West walls of their precious metal lining and took it with them on their caravan to rebuild Morglordia.</p>
