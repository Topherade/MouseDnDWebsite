<h3>Terrain</h3>
        	<p>The mice of Colchester are mostly refugees, though they have  accepted the native people as their own. The land borders heavily upon the  Terrapin Bay. The mice along the bay stay close to the coast, and work mostly  as ship builders and fishers - these mice are primarily descendants of natives.  The mice who live inland use the sand loam of the nearby area to grow grapes  and create wine, as their ancestors did before them. The further inland a mouse  lives, the more wealth he is likely to have.</p>
<h3> Common Wildlife </h3>
            <li>Frogs</li>
            <li>Crabs</li>
            <li>Gulls</li>
            <li>Pelicans (Rare)</li>
            
            
            <h3> Areas of Note</h3>
            <li>Testundines - This city is the capital of Colchester, and is where the  Council of Elders sits. In the center of the city is a great cathedral, built  from the stacking of 3 mighty tortoise shells. The bottom level is open to the  public for worship and sacrifice, while the top two levels house the Elders and  their closest followers. As one moves away from the cathedral, the city is in a  state of disarray. With the exception of the church, the mice of Testundine are  quite impoverished. It has been a source of tension for many moons.</li>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <li>Biejia - Biejia is the home to the largest market in Colchester, and  provides the majority of the mice in the realm with a place to sell their  wares. Markets of crops, glass, wine and diamonds litter the streets, and this  is the place that money flows most easily. Street kids dart between stands and  brothels can be found close to every inn.            </li>
