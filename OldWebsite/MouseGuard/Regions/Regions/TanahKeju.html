            <h3>Terrain</h3>
        	<p>The Minamot region has farmlands near the Gonglu Road, with forests towards the east of it.  In the middle of the region is Pengzi, a fort that rivils that of the capital of Edo.  Although it is not as large, it has its many defenses built into it.

            <h3> Areas of Note</h3>
            <li>Pengzi - A great fort that rivals the strength of Edo.  Although it is not as big and only has one floor, Pengzi has hanging houses and bridges inside that make it difficult for attackers to reach and conquire it.  There is an interior metal fort that the Genji control has has never fallen.  Only when faced with starvation did the Genji concede.</li>
