            <h3> Areas of Note</h3>
            <li>Oros - The Seat of the Weishu Clan - Oros is an underground city carved into the marble bedrock of the Heiqiuling hill.  Because of the frequent bandit raids, the city was formed in a highly defensible manner, with a few well guarded common entrances.  The city is a true underground labyrinth, formed from former mining tunnels.</li>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

			<li>The Mines of Mousia - a saphire and marble mine, produces the main exports from the Heiqiuling region. </li>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>Oyama Shrine - Oyama Shrine is a stronghold city built on a strip of land between the Standing Mountain and Lake Kurobe. Tall granite walls fortify the city, built from stones rolled off the Standing Mountain. Beneath the city lies a rich platinum mine which supplies the mints of Hojo. At the western end lies Oyama Palace, the former seat of House Oyama. Oyama Shrine was officially annexed by Heiqiuling in 928 AT.<br>
		    </li>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>The Standing Mountain - The Holy Site of Kumogataru. This is the second stop on a young Weishu mouse's pilgrimage to enlightenment.</li>
