            <h3>Terrain</h3>
        	<p>The Aokigahara region is heavly wooded.  Taisha Shrine is a large fort on the edge of the Immortal Mountain.  Since Taisha Shrine is restricted to non-Taisha, only the main enterence and sub towns get trade traffic.  General atmosphere of the region is a dense woodland.

            <h3> Areas of Note</h3>
            <li>Taisha Shrine - The Taisha Shrine is closed off to all but the Hijo Daimyo and the Taisha themselfs.  Vistors are allowed to stay in the inn and visit the markets as well as worship at the pilgramage shrine in the first district but the 2nd district and the other 2 floors are off limits to outsiders.  Small villages have sprouted up at the crossroads outside of the shrine and often attact pilgrams who wish to worship Komodoensis.</li>
            <li>The Immortal Mountain - Holy site for Komodoensis.  Pilgrams who are pure of faith and bolstered in faith make their way up to the summit for a chance to commune with Komodoensis.  Many do not survice the journey there and back.</li>
            <li>The Sea of Trees - The trees in the woods have a sensation of watching waves when looking at it.  Compasses malfunction in the woods from an abundance of iron deposits.  People who wander through feel as though the trees pull people in one direction or another. </li>
