            <h3>Terrain</h3>
        	<p>The Decon Swamps are a desolate poisonous region.  The swamps are treacherous for unprepared mice.  The northern parts of the swamp are
relatively forested, while many southern parts are completely covered in marsh and bodies of water. In the center is the Boka Boka tree, a Large tree that's roots span the entire swamp land.</p>

            <h3> Areas of Note</h3>
            <li>Boka Boka Tree - A Large tree in the center of the Decon Swamps. When the Pillars of Hojo formed in 950 AT, the tree budded for the first time in 1000 moons. Some say that when the tree flowers it will release vast ammounts of spiritual energy that has been stored up for centuries.</li>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <li>Kuruma Crater - Apparently a massive crater that is a nest for Qilithe Insects. These insects capture and integrate other species into their hive structure.</li>
