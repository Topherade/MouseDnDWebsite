            <h3> Mice of Note</h3>
            <li>Oyama Hamapeng - Oyama Hamapeng is one of the most well known mice in Hojo.  She is the original settler of Hojo, after scouting the area in the winter of 89 AT.
During her scouting mission, Hamapeng and her party became lost in a blizzard, setting camp at the base of the Standing Mountain.  Hamapeng's party was trapped at
the Standing Mountain for the rest of winter, and quickly ran out of food.  Forced into cannabalism, the group began eating the dead, then the weak.  Hamapeng was
the final survivor; near the break of winter she was on the verge of starvation.  After eating her own left arm in an attempt to survive, Rinju appeared to her.
Rinju asked one request from Hamapeng before helping her; Hamapeng had to eat her own tongue in Rinju's name.  Hamapeng, desperate to survive, performed this task.
Rinju gave Hamapeng food and water, then helped her set up a more permanent camp at the Kurobe Lake.  When a second party of scouts came to the Kurobe Gorge to 
find the party, they found Hamapeng's city and settled the land.</li>
            
                  
			<h3> History of The Hijo</h3>
        	<p>The Oyama have long held power in the Eastern Kurobe Gorge.  Protected by the old Rinju spirit, they began agriculture along the Kurobe River deep in
the Kurobe Gorge.  The Oyama also began mining the Kurobe Gorge in 864 AT when platinum was discovered, which quickly became the main currency in Hojo.
The Oyama helped the Hijo in their rebellion assuming they would stick to the Rinju religion.  Before the rebellion, mouses of Hijo frequently travelled through
their territory on pilgrimage to the Standing Mountain.  They have seen much less travelers since the switch to Komodoenisis by the Shojun and Emporeror.
Because of the heritage to Oyama Hamapeng, the clan elders of the Oyama clan eat their own tongue in the name of Rinju.
