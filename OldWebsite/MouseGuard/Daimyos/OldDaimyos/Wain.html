            <h3> Mice of Note</h3>
            <li>Burusu Wain - Burusu Wain was the third son of the lineage of the Wain family.  In 892 AT Burusu came across a new cask after mining through the wall in the Diku and as such brought much rejoicing as it quinched the thurst for 50 moons.</li>
            
                  
			<h3> History of The Wain</h3>
        	<p>The Wain have been a proud family of brewers and wine makers for as long as mice can remember.  They are a very fickle group, only worshipping Soloensis as they believe it benefits  them with trade.  They often do not involve themselves in wars that other Daimyos fight, and follow who ever is in control of Edo.
