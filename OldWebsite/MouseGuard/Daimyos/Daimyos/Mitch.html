            <h3> Mice of Note</h3>
            
            <li> Godzilla Takamaru - The wealthiest native mouse of the county of Rodes, used his great wealth to unite the remaining free native mice in 668 AT to rise up against the slavers and pirates and take their land back.  Godzilla Takamaru spared the lives of the captured pirates and became the first Servant of The Rodes.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bob and Rewenna Takamaru - After a great flood in 910 AT that nearly decimated the Rodes, Rewenna Takamaru was the only remaining heir of Godzilla Takamaru. Luckily, she met and fell in love with Bob, a smart and just lawman of Roderoth. The two produced four heirs before being eaten by birds.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bob Jr. Takamaru 916 AT Counselor- Though Bob Jr. always knew his younger brother would be selected as Servant, he has always felt his responsibility as the oldest child to be a leader and defender for his people. While Allen stayed inside and studied history and ethics and government with Bob and Rewenna, Bob Jr. sought an alternative education which would complement the abilities of his brother. Holding fast to the Rode philosophy that struggle produces strength, he spent many moons risking his life working as a hired sword for those he deemed worthy of his service. During this time he developed skills for tracking and wilderness survival as well as a superior physical fitness that made him a great candidate for Councilor when the time came to send one.
	Bob Jr. is relatively weak and unlikeable, he suffers greatly from his familys genetic misfortune, and he is inferior in most respects to his younger brother Allan. He is, however, much smarter and quicker than the average mouse and has used these strengths to develop a skill set Takamaru mice rarely get while all holed up in their old city of Roderoth. He is also fiercely loyal to the Rodes and eager to fight their enemies. </li>
    <p></p>
    		<li> Allan Takamaru 916 AT Heir -
	Despite having emerged early as the prodigy of the family and future Servant, Allan never felt like the star child. He always looked up to his older brother Bob Jr. and admired the adventurous life he lived. Allan has spent the majority of his days observing the matters and functions of the Rode government and studying various subjects of academia. His parents instilled in him a very strong sense that his duty as leader was not any credit to his own virtue and did not set him above any other mice. The leader of the Rodes is called Servant because his job is to serve the Rodes. As Servant, Allan has sought to expand the resources, freedom, and influence of Rode scholars and artists and further reform the clans prized justice system</li>
            
                  
			<h3> History of The Rodes</h3>
        	<p>The history of the mice who came to be known as The Rodes is fraught with misfortune and tragedy. Their home resides where the largest northern road in Mousteros meets Terrapin Bay, and the land was greatly coveted by the Rodes early enemies, most notably the cutthroat pirate mice of Terrapin Bay who terrorized all of the unprotected wealth running through the highly populated and trafficked territory. The woody seaside was home to only poor mice who lacked a centralized government or the law enforcement to deal with the kind of crime that great amounts of merchant traffic attracts. Goods were flowing in and out of the port now known as Roderoth and were just as soon snatched up by highwaymen and criminals. By a certain point the pirates had set up a permanent settlement at the port and violence and thievery became the law of the land. The native mice were captured and sold into slavery and the entire shire of Roderoth was ruled under the iron paw of tyranny. That was when Godzilla Takamaru, the wealthiest native mouse of the county, used his great wealth to unite the remaining free native mice to rise up against the slavers and pirates and take their land back. According to their history, Godzilla Takamaru spared the lives of the captured pirates and became the first Servant of The Rodes.
		  </p>
            <p>Since then, The Rodes have dealt with a great deal of other disastrous misfortunes that have dwindled their numbers and almost wiped them out. Throughout the ages, the Servant has been chosen from each generation of Godzilla Takamarus lineage by their parent to lead and serve the united mice that now call themselves The Rodes. Takamarus family remains the wealthiest and the area exists in a sort of feudal system with the majority of property owned by the single ruling family.
		  </p>
            <p> The culture of law and rule for The Rodes has always held Justice, Compassion, Truth, and Challenge above all else. Their philosophy is that hardship makes us stronger so that we can help others better.</p>
