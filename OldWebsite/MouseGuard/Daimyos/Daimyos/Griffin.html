            <li>
Famu Jianzei - Leader of the Sucession.  Jianzei lead the secession from the 
oppresively religious Weishu clan in 738 AT.  Tired of their zealous following 
of Komodoenisis, he asked the toad spirit Rinju for help in becoming independant. 
Rinju ignored Jianzei's request, and Doros was quickly overrun and sacked by 
the Weishu clan.  Jianzei and a few loyal family members survived, hiding in the 
northern forests of the Kurobe Gorge.  With all hope gone, Jianzei's rebellion 
was on the verge of disbanding.  Jianzei gave one final speech, asking for his 
mice to give one final push into Doros to drive out the Weishu.  Only at his 
lowest point did Rinju answer Jianzei's request, sending a plague of bull frogs
through Doros.  The Weishu clan fell back, vowing to claim the territory one day.</li>
            
                  
			<h3> History of The Hijo</h3>
        	<p>Since Jianzei's rebellion, the Famu have thrived controlling trade in the Gonglu 
region.  The Famu made heavy profits off the Hijo rebellion, switching sides at
a whim whenever it meant gold.  They charge high taxes passing through their 
territory, and have high tariffs.  Because of their greed, the Famu are heavily 
disliked by both the Hijo and the Genji.  The Weishu clan almost reclaimed the
Gonglu territory at the end of the rebellion, but the shogun, in an effort to 
create peace, intervened in the conflict and drove the Weishu back.
