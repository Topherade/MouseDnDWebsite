Musume Guidya - The Great Diplomat</li>
            <p> Musume Guidya was the Great-Great-Grand Daughter of Inja Guidya who was murdered in 920 AT. In 966 AT, Musume worked closely with Timothy Rhodes, a representive from the Fifth NingyoMordla Legilation, in bring Numa into Hojo to gain protection from the moles and rebels that surround it. Timothy keep in contact with the Guidya family since their gift of silver candle sticks to his family. Musume represented woodworkers in the Council of Nine and caused the Numa's loggin industry to pick up.</p>
            <li>Kyodai Doraggu - The First Spirit Conduit</li>
            <p>Kyodai Doraggu was the son of Kendo Doraggu the representive of Illegal Herb Growers in the council of Nine in 966 AT. When Numa joined Hojo, his industry was outlawed and replaced by medicine. As such Kendo took Kyodai deep into the Decon Swamps to hide from the authorities. When Kyodai was only 5 days old, Kendo ran out of food and started to feed Kyodai Nossu herb to take his hunger pains away. Since the latent spiritual energy of Hojo had been increased by the Pillars of Hojo, the Nossu Herb caused Kyodai to become the first non-Tobo to conduit a lesser spirit. Kendo took Kyodai back to Numa to show the Council of Nine and they wisked Kyodai off to the Izu institute for further research.</p>

			<h3> History of Numa</h3>
        	<p>Numa has been the Gathering place of Rohans, banished lords and lessor nobles, for the last two hundred moons. It built into the roots of a large willow tree on the shores of a swamp and has largely been able to fend for itself. When the Moles to the SouthEast started to encroach on their land, they sought the aid of the Rhodes Mice to the north. Under the Leadership of Musume Guidya and with Timothy Rhodes as a sponser, Numa became a part of Hojo to defend against their Mole neighbors.</p>
        	<p>Numa is rule by the Council of Nine. The Council is made up of the leaders of the nine major industries of Numa: Mining, Logging, Woodworking, Stoneworking, Blacksmithing, Illegal Herb Growing, Merchants, and Mercenaries. When they became apart of Hojo, Illegal Herbs were outlawed and as such their spot on the council was replaced with Medicine.</p>
