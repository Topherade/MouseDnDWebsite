			Mice of Note
		</h3>
            	
		<li> 
			Di Yi Wei - The Founder
		<p>
			Born with a whip in his hand, Di Yi Wei was a god amoung mice.  During the barn cat rampages of 438 AT, 
			Yi Wei enslaved a cat army, enlisting brave mice knights to ride them into battle.  Yi Wei single handedly
			turned the tide of battle, driving the cats out of Mouseteros.  His name was so feared amoung the goliath mammals
			that cats did not return for 100 years after his death.  Before his death, Yi Wei was witnessed climbing a great oak
			from which he never returned.  Some claim that he enslaved a spirit in that oak, and he can be seen every 1st moon
			of Harvest flying a spirit owl across the night sky.</p>
		</li>

            	
            	<li> 
			Wei Laoshu - The Ambitious
		<p>
			The Wei clan can seldomly be found in the annuls of history aside from the legend of Di Yi Wei.  Many mice before Wei
			Laoshu accepted their rank as slaver, staying out of the politics of Hojo.  However, during the Hijo Rebellion, Wei Laoshu
			saw an opportunity to bring his house to power.  His father, Wei Fuqin, forbade Laoshu's enlistment in the war. Laoshu
			stole off in the night, taking a bandy of slaves and twenty good mice with him.  Laoshu joined the Taisha at 
			the battle of Pengzi against the Genji, proving himself not only as a valuable warrior, but a powerful commander leading 
			his slaves into battle.  Laoshu later brought troops to Gonglu, with the intention of returning the territory to Heiqiuling
			lands.  This effort was thwarted by the Hijo clan, and Laoshu was forced to return to his home, shunned by the shogun.</p>
		</li>

  		
           	<li> 
			Wei Heishu - The Honorbound
		<p>
			Heishu, third son of Wei Laoshu, represented the Weishu clan in the council of 916 AT.  Heishu made major discoveries acting
			chiefly as a man of honor.  He kept his word, releasing Mira Mika, a prostitute whose information lead to the capture of the
			bandits in the Aokigahara forest.  Additionally, he released Shiro Bengoshi after finding no conclusive evidence for conviction.
			Heishu returned to his clan with missing a leg, but with a refined pride as an officer of the law, not a slaver.</p>
		</li>

    	   	
    	   	<li> 
			Wei Jiashu - The Pilgrim
		<p>
			Jiashu is the heir of Wei Laoshu.  He has been deeply influenced by brother, who has pushed him towards taking the family in a new
			direction as mice of the law.  As the heir of the Weishu clan, Jiashu went on the pilgrimage to the Immortal Mountain in 918 AT.  
			There, he pledged to continue in his father's path and bring his family to power; not as slavers, however, but as keepers of faith and peace.</p>
		</li>
        
        <li> Wei Wenzhong - The Liberator of Oyama Shrine
        <p>In 926 AT, Wenzhong lead an attack on Oyama Shrine, seiging the city.  Having already sustained heavy losses in a war with the Famu, the Oyama quickly surrendered their territory.  Wei Wenzhong began the expansionist period in Weishu history.

        </p>
        </li>
        
                <li> Wei Wusheng - The Slayer of Yogoroth
        <p>In 928 AT, Wusheng worked with the council to kill a cat roaming the lands of Hojo.  Wusheng lead the tracking efforts, and in the eventual fight with the the cat, dealt a killing blow.  Allegedy, Wusheng sustained heavy injuries in the fight, and was instantly healed by Komodoenisis.  This slain cat would later be known as Yogoroth.


        </p>
        </li>
                <li> Wei Zhengfu - The Breaker of Chains
        <p>
        In 932 AT, Zhengfu, with help from the Morgla and Dreadwood mice, lead the charge to remove the treacherous Famu government from power.  After taking Doros, Zhengfu created the territory now known as the People's Republic of Gonglu.  Zhengfu set up a democratically elected parliament in the city, and created government stipends and contracts to help entrepeneurs set up factories and workshops.  

<p> </p>
Zhengfu became known as the Breaker of Chains after he released all of the Weishu clan's slaves.  After offering to pay them higher salaries than the national average, he was able to retain these workers while simultaneously ending a growing tension in Heiqiuling.

        </p>
        </li>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
                <li> Wei Mingxing - The Avatar of Komodoenisis
        <p>In 936 AT, Mingxing lead the Weishu clan in the Burning of Edo.  Leading an army of spider cavalry, he climbed the walls of Edo, where he found the Hijo army on the top floor.  Gaining the Hijo commander's trust, Mingxing offered to help carry the Hijo army down the walls of Edo, since the bottom floors were both engulfed in flames and full of rats.  In a single smooth betrayal, Mingxing commanded his men to push the Hijo army off their spiders, taking control of a large diamond blood amulet.  Mingxing immediately used the blood amulet to summon the lizard spirit Komodoenisis.  With the spirit under his control, Mingxing first commanded it to destroy the rat army invading Edo.  He then lead the spirit to Kyo, where the spirit consumed the entire male line of the Tobo line, allowing Mingxing to force marry into the Tobo princess Reipu Tobo and become the new Emperor.  Mingxing is finally known for leading discussions in creating the new government of Hojo, setting up a government similar to what his father created in Doros.
        </p>
        </li>
        
          <li>Wei Kaishek - Father of Nationalism </li>
          <p>In 962 AT, Kaishek officially created the nationalist party of Heiqiuling. Having returned from the Ratin frontline, Kaishek learned the true meaning of Kumogataru's principle of Unity. Kaishek encouraged his people and his predecessors to focus their attention on foreign threats and shun domestic conflict.</p>
          <li>Wei Ankong - Yogoroth's Chosen<br>
          In 974 AT, Ankong began leading the Kyodai Doraggu experiments. By 978 AT, Ankong had successfully helped create three new conduits before the experiments came to a conclusion. With access to the Institute's Nossu Herb farm, Ankong became obsessed with becoming a conduit himself. He performed a pilgrimage to each of the mountains of Hojo, consuming only Nossu Herb, hard bread, and water.Â  When he reached the top of the Primal Mountain, Yogoroth lashed out at Ankong, knocking him unconscious. Ankong awoke a week later in a euphoric condition. He wandered home, claiming that he could hear the trees and feel the wind. Ankong was the first conduit of Yogoroth; he never learned to use his powers, but his euphoric state was a sensory realization of Hojo's latent energy.</li>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <li>Wei Hanlu - The Wrathful<br>
          In 985 AT, Hanlu became a conduit to Yogoroth after his pilgrimage to the three mountains. He spent the next several moons at the Izu Institute as a historian and experimenter. In 990 AT, the largest organized group of bandits from Ronina raided Oros. Using his innate spiritual ties to nature, Hanlu tracked down the bandits and destroyed their camp. Hanlu's body was never found, but Weishu scouting parties found the remains of the destroyed camp. Hanlu had single-handedly killed 33 bandits.</li>

	   	<h3> 
			History of the Weishu Clan </h3>
		<p>
			The Weishu clan was founded by Di Yi Wei, 
and used to include the lands of Gonglu. 
When the clan owned the Gonglu territory, 
it was heavily involved with trade with the rest of Hojo. 
Deeply religious, the clan has followed the Komodoenisis spirit since it claimed 
domain on the Immortal Mountain. The Famu clan, tired of this religious 
oppression, split off to follow the Renji spirit. Losing access to a main 
route of trade, Weishu clan became 
more introverted and excluded. The clan has long shunned politics, instead 
prefering to defend their own. For a long time, the clan has had to deal with 
the difficulties of bordering the Decon Swamp and Ronina contested borderlands, 
of which they've recieved help sparringly.</p>
		<p>After the overthrow of the Minamoto Shogun in 908 AT by the Hijo Dynasty, the Weishu Clan went through an age of aggression and expansion. Working with the Morgla Mice as a guarded ally, the Weishu mice annexed Oyama Shrine in 928 AT and part of Doros in 932 AT. In 936 AT, during the sacking of Edo, the Weishu mice betrayed the Hijo Shogun, installing a puppet government and taking over the title as emperor. The family has since split into the Weizhu (who hold the title as Emperor and the lands of TenoHeiqiuling) and the Weishu, who hold the ancient homelands of the Wei Daimyo.</p>
		<p>From 936 AT until the present day, the Weishu clan has focused on the studies of spirit magic, playing a key role in the history of the Izu Institute. During this time period, a nationalist movement swept through Heiqiuling. Instead of picking up arms against fellow mice, the Weishu clan has focused its military force on Ronina and the Ratin front lines.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	
<H3>Culture of the Weishu Clan</H3>
<p>
The Weishu clan is a strict theocracy; as such, no ungodly mouse shall sit the Throne of Oros. To prove himself worthy, the Weishu heir must make a pilgrimage to the three mountains of Hojo. First, he must ascend the Immortal Mountain, where he must pray and sacrifice to Komodoenisis. This leg of the pilgrimage represents his power to rule over Heiqiuling.
Second, he must ascend the Standing Mountain. There, he will learn how to keep his people united. Finally, he must journey to the Primal Mountain. This leg of the journey proves his humility to the spirits of the Pillars of Hojo. If Yogoroth accepts the heir's sacrifice, he is proved a godly mouse.</p>
