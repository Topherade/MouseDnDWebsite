            <h3> Mice of Note</h3>
            <li>Wiljoe the First Morgla - The offspring of a the orginal Heir of Mordla whom died before marriage and a drugged up Heartbreaker Bog mouse, Wiljoe had mental issues caused by the drug use of his mother. He was given over to the Morgla clan for his upbringing but was then sold off to the Weishu Daimyo for sacrifice to Komodoensis. Wiljoe was forced to breed with an Oyama slave princess before he was sacrificed.  His seed was strong and he produced a son with his same mental issues. </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Wiljoe IV  NingyoMorgla - Wiljoe IV was the First Shogun of the NingyoMorgla line. When the High Council overthrew the Hijo Government in 936AT they wrote the Charter of 936 AT as the governing contract of Hojo. This charter created gave the shogun over to the heir of the Morgla line, which Wiljoe IV was the true heir. The charter then created the NingyoMorgla line, with Wiljoe IV as the root, that would hinceforth maintain the Shogunate. Having sever mental aliments from years of inbreeding with retards, Wiljoe IV was more of a puppet then a shogun.</li>
            
                  
			  <h3> History of The NingyoMordla Daimyo</h3>
        	<p>The NingyoMordla Daimyo was a split from the Mordla Daimyo in 912AT. Wiljoe I was born from the deceased Mordla heir and a Heartbreaker Bog mouse. Due to the drug use of his mother, Wiljoe I had sever mental issues. He was sacrificed but was forced to breed with the fallen Oyama clan in secret by the Weishu. Wiljoe II and Wiljoe III were forced to inbreed with their sisters to keep the line pure. Wiljoe IV was revealed to be the true heir of the Mordla line after the overthrow of the Hijo. The reformation and Charter of 936AT brought about the NingyoMordla Daimyo as the new Shogunate line with Veto power of the newly created legislation. </p>
        	<p>The NingyoMordla line has allows been ailed by forms of mental illness from the line of Wiljoe I as well as the inbreeding for multiple generations. They have fits of rage as well as not grasping simple concepts and are often puppeted by the Daimyo that manages to befriend or control them.</p>
