   <h3> Mice of Note</h3>
   <li>Bearn Ruorm/Wain - The Great Trailblazer</li>
   <p>Before the Republic of Changlu claimed the land of the Wain people in 946 AT, Bearn Wain was the owner of one of the smaller wineries of the Wain people, and a secret worshipper of Mydas. When the Republic of Changlu claimed all the vineyards and their surrounding lands as eminent domain, Bearn was one of few Wain&rsquo;s to flee the area, rather than stay and fight. He convinced his small group of 500 refugees to renounce Soloensis, whose speed and anger had brought them nothing but misfortune, and join him in his worship of Mydas.</p>
   <p>As the Wain refugees neared the land of the coast in 948 AT, Mydas came to Bearn in a dream and warned him that the Wain&rsquo;s of Changlu were planning to poison their remaining wine reserves before the Changlu confiscated them. In an attempt to spare the lives of his people, Bearn officially disowned the Wain name and family and pledged upon the name of Ruorm instead.</p>
   <p>As reward for converting his people, Mydas blessed Bearn and his shamans and fortold of a great rupturing. He warned Bearn that he although he might disappear for awhile to still hold faith in him. In return he shall bless his people with his power at that time.</p>
   <li>Grage Ruorm - The First Conduit of Mydas</li>
   <p>When the pilars of Hojo formed from Yogoroths tantrum in 950AT, Mydas went missing. Before Mydas left, he blessed Beorn's dagger with his spiritual energy. When the institute discovered how to conduit spirits in 966 AT, Bearn's son, Graige, with the dagger his father gave him become the first of the Ruorm line to become a conduit of Mydas.</p>
   <p>With his new found powers, Graige started one of the only wineries located on the coast, and presses grapes for wine at a faster rate than any before.  He acted as a Ruorm council elder until his dealth in 980 AT.</p>
<h3> History of Colchester</h3>
  	<p>The mice of Colchester are a relatively new group.  When the Ruorm family established their claim to the land, the peasants were willing to accept them fairly easily, since they brought with them wine and the favor of Mydas.  As the priests began preaching throughout the land, many followers were able to conduct Mydas as well.  This gift, when used by many mice at once, permitted the Colchester people to create new commodities, the most substantial of which being glass from the sands of their nearby beaches.  Colchester glass is now a luxurious accessory to any wealthy mouse&rsquo;s home.  The area is within a time of great prosperity. </p>
