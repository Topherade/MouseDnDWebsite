            	<li> 
			Kaino Morgla
		<p>
			The recorded start of the Morgla clan.  The son of a crippled farmer, Morgla, unable to cope with his father’s disability,
			 fled his home and become a prospector.  He explored the farthest corners of the country to discover what minerals could be ripped from the earth.
			  Finding himself in what is modern-day Morglordia, he happened upon a deep cave network, the Crawling Mines in fact. 
			 Heedless of the danger he delved into the depths of the caverns and found himself hopelessly lost.  Terrified and alone, 
			he huddled in the darkness of the pits for days until he was eventually happened upon by a pair of rhino beetles. 
			 For some reason, perhaps sensing his desperation and fear, they guided him to water, a spring in the middle of a large nest of the insects.
			  He stayed there for a long time, and the ancient scrolls only say he “communed” with them.  Regardless of what transpired in those tunnels,
			 5 days later Morgla Kaino emerged from the Crawling Mines with a beautiful female and male beetle as his companions and guardians.
			  Those two beetles formed the legendary stock of the beetles of the Morgla clan.  With this bloodline of beasts and abundant copper veins found in the mines,
			 Morgla was able to carve out a section of Mousteros for himself, establishing Oakwall village a short distance from his famous mines.
		</p>

           	<li> 
			Kaidya Lao
		<p>
			The grandson of Kaino Morgla, Kaidya Lao was an engineer and the main developer of the Crawling Mines,
			 coordinating the creation of the majority of the mineshafts and tunnels that have become the lifeblood of the Morgla clan. 
			 With revolutionary designs of rhino beetle cooperation and harnesses, he increased the revenue of the clan by leaps and bounds. 
			 This flow of money allowed the clan to expand its borders, pushing into the West Kurobe Gorges. 
			 Tensions grew and the first skirmishes began between the two clans.  Rhino beetles were used for the first time as combat beasts, 
			proving to be vicious additions to the Morgla clan’s fighting squads.  Casualties mounted and the two clans eventually came to a peace agreement,
			 settling borders far into Mizumi territory.  Kaidya Lao became revered as a warrior and creator for the clan.
			  He inspired many descendants to push the borders and power of the clan, forming a cohesive sense of the Swarm society.
		</p>
		</li>

    	   	
    	   	<li> 
			Heijo Morgla
		<p>
			The great-grandson of Kaidya Lao, Heijo was one of the first of the Morgla clan to be sent to the Council.
			  He was also the first to attempt to expand the simple copper ore trade deals with Edo that the clan had always depended upon.
			  To this end he explored the more profitable avenues associated with both the smelting and the crafting of copper materials.
			  Constructing a forge to cut the costs of paying a smelter, refining the ore to create bronze, further increasing profits.
			  He also assigned guard duties to the transported copper, increasing their security.  A true businessman and prince.

	   	<h3> 
			Aspects of Morgla Clan Society </h3>
		<p>
			The relationship between the mine and the collective is incredibly integral to a mouse growing up in clan Morgla.
			  Mining is one of the most prestigious jobs a mouse can hold, providing for the clan’s continued well being as well as communing directly with the roots of the clan and their symbiotic partners,
			 the Japanese Rhino Beetles.  Each miner has a close relationship with one selected beetle and carries that connection for the rest of their lives.
			  Used for mining, combat, protection and as beasts of burden, the Rhino Beetles are essential and beloved by Morgla society.
			  Their selfless nature as parts of a collective whole has transferred to the way Morgla clan mice live their lives as well.
			  Sacrificing oneself, or parts of oneself for the good of the clan is the most honorable act one can do.
			  Miners and devout followers of Xhangdou have been well known to amputate limbs or extremities to show their devotion to the whole.
			  Many of these injuries are attributed to mining accidents, if only to keep up the appearance of following Komodoenisis.

	   	<h3> 
			History of the Morgla Clan</h3>
		<p>
			Although short, the history of the Morgla clan is very integrally connected to the earth, beetles, and ore.
			  It forms the core of their strength, both militarily, economically, and spiritually.  By considering the whole greater than the sum of its parts,
			 the clan has had extraordinary success and operates with almost inhuman efficiency amongst the most devout of followers.
			  The clan believes that much of its greatest history is yet to come.
