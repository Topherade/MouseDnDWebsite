            <h3> Mice of Note</h3>
           
<li> Wei Mingxing - The Avatar of Komodoenisis 
        <p>In 936 AT, Mingxing lead the Weishu clan in the Burning of Edo.  Leading an army of spider cavalry, he climbed the walls of Edo, where he found the Hijo army on the top floor.  Gaining the Hijo commander's trust, Mingxing offered to help carry the Hijo army down the walls of Edo, since the bottom floors were both engulfed in flames and full of rats.  In a single smooth betrayal, Mingxing commanded his men to push the Hijo army off their spiders, taking control of a large diamond blood amulet.  Mingxing immediately used the blood amulet to summon the lizard spirit Komodoenisis.  With the spirit under his control, Mingxing first commanded it to destroy the rat army invading Edo.  He then lead the spirit to Kyo, where the spirit consumed the entire male line of the Tobo line, allowing Mingxing to force marry into the Tobo princess Reipu Tobo and become the new Emperor.  Mingxing is finally known for leading discussions in creating the new government of Hojo, setting up a government similar to what his father created in Doros. </p>

                <li>
Wei Fangzhi - The Purger of Rinju
        <p>
        In 940 AT, Fangzhi lead the efforts to purge the spirit of Rinju from the Standing Mountain. Having lost all of his followers, Rinju was extremely weak by the time Fangzhi had scaled the peak.  Fangzhi, with help from Dreadwood, relocated the spider spirit, Kumogataru, to the Standing Mountain.

        </p>
        </li>
        
          <li> Wei Jinshen - The Creator of Yogoroth
        <p>
        In 948 AT, Jinshen lead an effort to create a mouse-made spirit.  After the flight of Soloensis from the White Mountain, Jinshen moved the bones of the cat, slain by his ancestor Wusheng, to the peak of the White Mountain.  After several days and nights of ceremony and ritual sacrifices, the spirit was born.  However, having squirrel bones mixed into the cat bones, the spirit was an abomination.  Nonetheless, Jinshen proved a valuable point in the newly emerging study of spirits.  After his success, he renamed The White Mountain to The Primal Mountain.

			<h3> History of The Weizhu</h3>
        	<p>The Weizhu Diamyo was created after the overthrow of the Hijo government. With the Greate Charter of 936AT, Mingxing Wei split from the Wei family, leaving Laoi Wei as the heir, and took the name of Mingxing Weizhu after exterminating the male line of the Tobo and forcefully marrying Reipu Tobo. </p>
        	<p>The Weizhu Diamyo has a history of exterminating any whom do not follow the tenets in the Pillars of Hojo. They have gone as far as killing off spirits that do not fit their ideals.</p>
