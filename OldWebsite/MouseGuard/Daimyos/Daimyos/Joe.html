              DMX Swampy - DMX was the leader of the people of  heartbreaker bog in the time of the great insurrection, where the god spirit  Komodoensis was summoned, cities were razed and the royal family wiped out. No  longer feeling safe for his people he led all those that remain on a great  pilgrimage to find a new home and a new destiny, he eventually led them to the  lost city of Kuma, hidden away inside the forgotten mountain. In the beginning  they started to make a life for themselves inside the guarded ancient walls,  however something was not right, strange noises were heard, uneasy feelings  were felt at all times. This led DMX to discover a long lost temple, containing  the then slumbering spirit of Ursine the bear. Not showing any fear DMX faced  the large beast, this impressed Ursine. Ursine explained that he had been  slumbering since before mice controlled this land, before his people usurped  him and cursed him to slumber alone. Eventually, what began as friendship and  curiosity turned into worship, and the rest of the Himitsu followed in tow, with  Ursine&rsquo;s guidance and strength, they were able to not only restore the former  glory of the shining city of Kuma, but improve upon it. When DMX passed away, the  people decided that the people of heartbreaker bog would need a new name for  their people, and to honor their beloved leader they chose the middle name of DMX,  &ldquo;Himitsu&rdquo;. This led to a long and prosperous period, leading the old people of  heartbreaker bog into new purpose, they had found their new destiny.

			<h3>History of The Himitsu</h3>
        	<p>After  the destruction of the former rule and the installation of the dreaded Willjoe into power,  the people of heartbreaker bog decided to go on a pilgrimage to find a new home  and a new purpose, this led them to Kuma, the ancient city, lost to time in the  forgotten mountain, surrounded by nothing but sand and death, they would make  their new home here. Soon after they arrived they discovered the bear spirt  Ursine, and through loyalty and strength they would work together to create a  new utopia for their people. The people have not only returned their home to  its former glory, but have improved on it in every way. The industrious  hardworking Himitsu people always strive for improvement, as their saying goes  &ldquo;The only time to stop making the world a better place is when you pass to a  new one&rdquo;.</p>
        	<h3>Traits of the Himitsu</h3>
            
            <p>The Himitsu people are a very spiritual group. They worship the bear god Ursine, who taught them the power of rock based magic, and use this to heighten their strength as well as defend their homeland. Although they are spiritual, many believe that technology will be the future for mice kind, so it is that the old is cherished here, as well as the new. Advancement is very important, and the Himitsu will spare no expense for creating or finding a new way forward. They are expert craftsman and workers, as such they cherish the artifacts of old they  discover in the areas of Kuma still not excavated. They are a very secretive group of people but are very loyal once you prove yourself to them. Strength and loyalty are what is most important to the people of Himitsu.</p>
