            <h3> Mice of Note</h3>
            <li>
  Jianzei Famu - Leader of the Sucession.  </li>
            <p>Jianzei lead the secession from the 
              oppresively religious Weishu clan in 738 AT.  Tired of their zealous following 
              of Komodoenisis, he asked the toad spirit Rinju for help in becoming independant. 
              Rinju ignored Jianzei's request, and Doros was quickly overrun and sacked by 
              the Weishu clan.  Jianzei and a few loyal family members survived, hiding in the 
              northern forests of the Kurobe Gorge.  With all hope gone, Jianzei's rebellion 
              was on the verge of disbanding.  Jianzei gave one final speech, asking for his 
              mice to give one final push into Doros to drive out the Weishu.  Only at his 
              lowest point did Rinju answer Jianzei's request, sending a plague of bull frogs
              through Doros.  The Weishu clan fell back, vowing to claim the territory one day.</p>
<p></p>
            <li>Uragirimono Famu - The Great Traitor</li>
            <p>Uragirimono was the Famu heir that went on the expedition to Torera with the 920 AT High Council. He was thought to have poisoned multiple council members and was left for dead after he was light on fire on the back of a grasshopper. Uragirimono returned in 928 AT inlisting the help of a small cat to bring vengence to the families who left him for dead. He was killed along with his cat by the 928 AT High Council.</p>
            <li>Chairoi Famu - The Redemmer</li>
            <p>Chairoi Famu worked for the redemption of the Famu line in the eyes of the High Daimyos. In 954 AT after convincing the Shogun Wiljoe VIII NingyoMordla, along with two thirds of the legislation, the Famu line was once again made into a High Daimyo. Chairoi was given control of Firestone Mesa after the Taiya had been removed from power. They renamed the provence to New Famu as a show of their new beginnings.</p>
            <p></p>
                  
			<h3> History of The Famu</h3>
        	<p>Since Jianzei's rebellion, the Famu have thrived controlling trade in the Gonglu 
region.  The Famu made heavy profits off the Hijo rebellion, switching sides at
a whim whenever it meant gold.  They charge high taxes passing through their 
territory, and have high tariffs.  Because of their greed, the Famu are heavily 
disliked by both the Hijo and the Genji.  The Weishu clan almost reclaimed the
Gonglu territory at the end of the rebellion, but the shogun, in an effort to 
create peace, intervened in the conflict and drove the Weishu back.
 			</p>
        	<p>Often thought as schemers by the other Daimyos, the Famu have been labeled as ones not to be trusted. After the fall of the Famu under Uragirimono, it took Chairoi 26 moons before the Famu were allowed into the Legislation.</p>
