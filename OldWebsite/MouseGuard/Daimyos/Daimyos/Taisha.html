          <h3> Mice of Note</h3>
            <li> Takatoki Taisha - The Younger Brother</li>
          <p> Takatoki and his older brother Tokimasa Hijo lead the Hijo Daimyo to victory against the former Genji Shogunate  in 908 AT.  After the victory, Takatoki married into the Taisha Daimyo and took over rule, converting to their religion, Komodoensis.</p>
            <li>Toshishita Taisha - The Converter</li>
            <p>With the Fall of the Hijo in 936AT, Toshishita had sided with his close ally Mingxing Wei.  When Mingxing set up the new government he told Toshishita of his grand idea of allowing all the spirits to coexist with each other on the three holy mountains.  Toshishita embraced this change and was one of the first backers of the Pillar of Hojo idea. </p>

			<h3> History of The Hijo</h3>
        	<p>The Taisha have long sense been a fevorish follower of the Komodoensis spirit.  As such, they keep their private lives much of a secret from the rest of mouseworld.  They have a strict family only area and  Taisha Shrine is only somewhat open to the little trade that they currently have.  They are wiery of others who do not follow the Pillars of Hojo, and do not trust those who follow other lessers spirits.
