            <h3> Mice of Note</h3>
            <li>Toko JiyuFamu - Leader of the People</li>
          <p>Toko was a bastard of the Famu line and a brothel wench. When the Mercs of Dreadwood, the Mordla, and the Wei Daimyo marched their armies into Doros in 932AT to overthrow the opressive Famu government, Toko rallied the peasent mice to armies and helped their liberators take control of Gonglu. Once the Famu were eliminated, Toko was elected by the people of the new province of Changlu to lead them. He promoted the tenits of business, industry, and commercialism and created a strong middle class for the mice of Changlu.</p>
          <p></p>
            <li>Toko Yuniti - The Great Uniter</li>
            <p>Toko Yuniti was elected Primier in 950 AT. As with his namesake, Toko worked to better the mice of Changlu. During this time, Doros was still segragated into 3 territories. When the 5th Legislation of NingyoMordla occured in 954 AT, Toko lobbied for the integration and soverity of Doros. This passed the Legislation and with it Changlu became unified and gained much of the surrounding territories as well as the great Doros wall falling.</p>

		  <h3> History of The Republic of Changlu</h3>
        	<p>The Republic of Changlu used to be the seat of the Famu lineage. Once the Famu fell in 932AT, The Republic of Changlu was created by the Dreadwood Mercs, The Mordla, and the Wei Daimyo. It was to be a free state, run by the people for the people, but was split between the three powers. The Wei district of Changlu pushed for industry, and under the leadership of Toko JiyuFamu, a Famu bastard, The Republic of Changlu was created. </p>
        	<p>It wasn't until 954AT in which Toko Yuniti united the three districts and formally unitfied Changlu. </p>
        	<p>As a Republic, Changlu has a tri-camerial legislation. The house of commons is the largest house with 100 seats, whos representitives are elected every moon by the common folks. The Hall of Lords is the second largest with 25 seats, whos representivies are elected by the common folks for life when a representive dies or retires. The Vestibule of Blood is the smallest with 10 seats, whos representivies inheirit or buy their seats from those who own them. Legislation and laws are passed with a simple majority through each house. Taxes, districting, and money bills originate in the House of Commons; laws, rules, and bans originate in the Hall of Lords; and domistic policy and foriegn affiars originate in the Vestibule of Blood. The legislation appoints a Primier that acts as a figurehead for Changlu as well as acts as their representive on the NingyoMordla Legislation.</p>
