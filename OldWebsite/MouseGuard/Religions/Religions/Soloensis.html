			<h3> About Soloensis</h3>
        	<p>Soloensis is the guardian spirit of the White Mountain.  She is a Hawk Spirit whom embodies Agility and Wrath.  Favor with Soloensis is gained through feats of Agility in her name, as well as offerings in her name.  Examples of these include worshipping at Shirayama shrine, breaking speed records in her name, preforming in her name, vengeance against rivals or offerings of the legs of mice. Commune can be reached with Soloensis at the Shirayama Shrine, in her mountain shrine, or through bird conduits after sacrifice. 
 			</p>
            <p>Often viewed by non-worshippers as scatter brained, worshippers of Soloensis are often very dexterious and quick, just not in mind.  With The White Mountain in their domain, the Shirayama are the most devout in their following of Soloensis.  They offer a moonly slave mouse to a local hawk in order to commune with her.  The Taiya hold gladitorial games in her honor on the full moon and new moon.  The Wain are relatively new believers converting in 910 AT after the Hijo switched their belief from Rinju to Komodoensis.
 			</p>
            <p>When Rinji was slain in 940 AT, Soloensis felt that he would be next and took to the sky and fled Hojo.</p>
