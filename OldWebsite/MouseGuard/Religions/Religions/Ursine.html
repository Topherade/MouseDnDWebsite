			<h3> About Komodeonsis</h3>
        	<p>Ursine  is the guardian spirit of the forgotten mountain. He was a long lost deity from  a forgotten age, his temple was unearthed by the wandering pilgrims of  heartbreaker bog when they made his mountain there home. Favor is earned by feats  of strength, respects characters with strong will, as well as unquestioning  loyalty. </p>
            <p>Ursine  was originally worshiped by the people of the desert nation of Sabaku, its  people disappeared before recorded history and were unknown until the pilgrims  of heartbreaker bogdiscovered an ancient lost city in the forgotten mountain,  now known as Kuma. Within they revealed the slumbering bear spirit known as  Ursine. Ursine radiates a trusting aura, as well as an intense strength. It is  said that to be in his presence is to know the very essence of strength, both  of mind and body. He bonded with the wayward mice of heartbreaker bog as they  had survived a great plight and were searching for a new destiny. Ursine aided  them in restoring Kuma to its former glory. He is as loyal to his subject&rsquo;s as  they are to him and he places high value into loyalty to one's  Allies. The Himitsu mice are very secretive when it comes to their religion and  don&rsquo;t share this information with outsiders, and as of today the location of  Ursine&rsquo;s temple in the mountain remains a secret, known only by the royalty of  Himitsu.</p>
