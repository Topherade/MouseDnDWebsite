			<h3> About Rinju</h3>
        	<p>Rinju is the guardian spirit of the Standing Mountain.  He is a Giant Toad Spirit whom embodies Endurance and Pride.  Favor with Rinju is gained through feats of Endurance, as well as sacrifices in his name.  Examples of these include surviving in the wilderness, perservance when hope is lost, feats of cooking, braving the Decon Swamps, or offerings of the tongues of mice. Commune can be reached with Rinju at Oyama Shrine, his mountain top shrine, or with toad or frog conduits in Lake Kurobe.

            <p>Rinju is the old spirit in Hojo, as such worshippers exist or have existed in all most every Daimyo.  Once the main spirit of the region, his worshippers abandoned him after the Hijo's rise to power in 908 AT.  When the Genji lost power, many of the worshippers help on as the emperior was still the avatar of Rinju, but soon too he was forced to switch to Komodoensis.  As such Rinju lost not only the Avatar, but also many Daimyos that jumped ship.  Worshippers are still strong in the Kurobe Gorges near his holy site, with the Famu and as well as the Genji.

            <p>With the rise of the Weizhu emperior in 936 AT,Rinji no longer had friends within the Hojo empire. Believing he was safe atop of his ancient home, Rinji feared no mouse. But he should have, lead by Fangzhi Weizhu in 940 AT, The legislation voted to purge the spirit of Rinji and created a force to assault his home. Armed with 500 mice, Fangzhi climbed to the summit and did battle with Rinji. After his physical form was defeated at the cost of 300 mice, Fangzhi fought Rinji in the spiritual realm while his men salted and burned his bones. When the bones were gone, Fangzhi gave the mortal blow to Rinji, but in his last act Rinji tore Fangzhi's spirit making him unable to rest peacefully.</p>
