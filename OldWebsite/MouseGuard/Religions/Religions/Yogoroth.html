        	<h3> About Yogoroth</h3>
        	<p>Yogoroth is the guardian spirit of the Primal Mountain. She is a mix between a Cat and a Squirrel and was one of the first documented mouse created spirits.  Favor can be earned through the sacrifice of mammals. A worthy sacrifice must be played with and tortured before it is offered up to Yogoroth.</p>

        	<h3>History</h3>
            <p>Before Yogoroth became a spirit, it was slain by the Hijo Council of 928 AT. The Weishu, wanting to experiment with creating new spirits and blood magic carried the bones to the top of the Primal Mountain after the elimation of Soloensis. Unfortunately, due to the Great Squirrel war of 932 AT, squirrel bones littered the gravesite of Yogoroth and were mixed in to her bones. This created the Cat-Squirrel Spirit Yogoroth that comsumes anything before her.</p>
