Takatoki then married into the Taisha clan and took their name and converted to Komodeonsis. Hijo also converted, as well as forcing the Emperior's house Tobo to convert.

            <p>The Weishu clan under Wei Mingxing forcefully took the Hijo's blood stone, and summoned Komodoenisis at the burning of Edo in 936 AT. This Weishu clan used his might to sack the Tobo's forbiden fortress and marry into their lineage for the bloodline power. The Weishu then went through a religious purging of Hojo elimating the other, old spirits, and installing a single religion with a pantheon of spirits.</p>
