            <h3> About Kumogataru</h3>
        	<p>Kumogataru is the guardian spirit of the Standing Mountain. His web represents the unity among the mice of Hojo, a complex web of interactions lead by a strong figure head. A strong web can bring down much greater enemies, but one missing strand may cause it to unravel under stress.  Favor with Kumogataru is gain through group acts of valor or leadership.</p>

        	<h3>History</h3>
            <p>Kumogataru was once a feared giant among the lands. Many traveling merchants have

gone missing and their remains have yet to be found. It wasn't until 915 that the beast was finally

tracked down and slain. It was a treacherous campaign that cost 28 mice their lives. Not much

was known of the great Kumogataru until that day. They tracked the beast to its cave filled with

winding tunnels and thick webs. Throughout the journey through the cave the spider would toy

with the men from the shadows and drove many of them mad. Kumogataru was said to be a

master of deception and instilled fear into his prey before making the kill. The men reported

hearing strange imitations of children and women screaming for help.</p>

<p>This lasted for 3 sleepless days as the mice traveled deeper into the caves slowly being

taken from the shadows. Near the final hours of the hunt they entered a large chamber where

they found Kumogataru had just finished wrapping one of their men up in webs. The beast put up

a good fight, killing 4 more mice in the battle before he was slain.</p>

<p>The surviving hunters cut down their friend that was hanging from the ceiling and

removed the web cocoon. The mouse was covered in burns and his legs had dissolved away, but

he still lived. The reason no remains were ever found was because Kumogataru had special

acidic venom that he injected into the web cocoons to dissolve his prey and suck them up like a

drink. The hunter said the entire time spent being wrapped up Kumogataru was whispering to him

strange words and imitating his screams of horror and pain.</p>
